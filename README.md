# openpgp-card
This is the source of the OpenPGP Card, with a few exceptions (functions under NDA, described in the source). It can be compiled and loaded into an BasicCard 7.5 from Zeitcontrol (www.basiccard.com). It was developed with the free development kit from Zeitcontrol, provided at the address above. I used version V8.55 of the development kit. You need a professional BasiscCard with version 7.5 or higher to run the code. The file Tlv12.def must be copied in the Lib-Folder of the development kit and is not provided by the latest kit. This code is provided as is, without any warranty.
