This is an example source of a full functional OpenPGP smart card.
It can be compiled and loaded into an BasicCard 7.5 from Zeitcontrol (www.basiccard.com).
It was developed with the free development kit from Zeitcontrol provided at the address above.
I used Version V8.25 of the development kit, you need a professional BasiscCard with Version 7.5 or higher to run the code.
This code is provided as is without any warranty.

The file Tlv12.def must be copied in the Lib-Folder of the development kit and is not provided by the latest kit.

The compiled code has about 28 KB (IMG), the professional version (source not available because it includes routines under NDA) has 35KB with the same functionality at the interface.
The reason for this 20% overhead are special functions against hardware attacks, that are not part of the free version.
If you need a high secure smart card, it is recommended to use the professional version or complete the source with the missing functionality.
